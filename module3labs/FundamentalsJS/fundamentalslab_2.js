//Solution: To use parseInt() function to convert string to a number
let three = parseInt("3") 
let four = parseInt("4") 
let thirty = parseInt("30") 
//what is the value of the following expressions? 
let addition = three + four 
console.log("addition = "+addition+"\n");

let multiplication = three * four 
console.log("multiplication = "+multiplication+"\n");

let division = three / four 
console.log("division = "+division+"\n");

let subtraction = three - four 
console.log("substraction = "+subtraction+"\n");

let lessThan1 = three < four 
console.log("Lessthan1 = "+lessThan1+"\n");

let lessThan2 = thirty < four
console.log("Lessthan2 = "+lessThan2+"\n");
