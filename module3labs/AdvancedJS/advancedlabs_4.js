/* 4. The Fibonacci sequence of numbers is a famous pattern where the next number in the 
      sequence is the sum of the previous 2.  e.g. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.

        a) Write a function printFibonacci() using setInterval that outputs a number in 
           the Fibonacci sequence every second.
        b) Write a new version printFibonacciTimeouts() that uses nested setTimeout calls
           to do the same thing 
        c) Extend one of the above functions to accept a limit argument, which tells it 
           how many numbers to print before stopping. */
