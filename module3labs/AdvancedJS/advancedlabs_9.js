/* 9. We can delay execution of a function using setTimeout, where we need to provide the 
      callback function to be executed after the delay.\
        a) Create a promise-based alternative randomDelay() that delays execution for a 
           random amount of time (between 1 and 20 seconds) and returns a promise we can use 
           via .then(), as in the starter code below
        b) If the random delay is even, consider this a successful delay and resolve the promise, 
           and if the random number is odd, consider this a failure and reject it
        c) Update the testing code to catch rejected promises and print a different message
        d) Try to update the then and catch messages to include the random delay value.
