	6. Number of customers each month: Array[{month: total_customer, year: year}]
	7. Rating each month: : Array[{month: rating, year: year}]
	8. Revenue each month: Array[{month: total_revenue, year: year}]
	
//Fundamental	
-- Object function
1. Make a object function to calculate total customer by year - Take year as an input (Slide 49 is example to make 
object function)
2. Make a object function to calculate the average rating by year - Take year as an input
3. Make a object function to calculate the average Revenue by year - Take year as an input

-- Function
4. Make a function to list all the restaurant that has the same suburb or postcode
getAllRestaurantBySuburbAndPostcode(string suburb, number postcode)

//Intermediate
5. Make a function to get the highest rating restaurant by month 
getHigestRatingRestaurantByMonth(number month, array rating_each_month)

6. Make a function to get the highest customers restaurant by month 
getHigestCustomerRestaurantByMonth(number month, array Number_of_customers)

7. Make a function to get the highest revenue restaurant by month 
getHigestCustomerRestaurantByMonth(number month, array Revenue_each_month)

// Advanced
8. Make a function to sort the restaurant based on revenue by month
getHigestRevenueRestaurantByMonth
9. Find the shortest distance to restaurant based on current location
