the second mini-project is designed to cover the React concepts learned in modules 6 and 7.
The goal is to create an interactive page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will
include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching
and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as bootstrap and MUI.

Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations:

1. What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

2. Give a high level overview of your application and its features
    The application allows a user to see a list of recipes and 
    save a new recipe

3. Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?
    The data comes from an external API and is retrieve using the axios library

4. How is this data processed and displayed?


5. How can the user interact with your application?


6. Have you used class components or functional components? Why?


7. How have you structured/broken up your components/code?


8. What kinds of React hooks have you used (eg. state, context, effect, navigate)? How?

9. What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/MUI)? How? Why?

10. How might you extend the features of your application in future?
